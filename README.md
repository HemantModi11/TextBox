# Text Utility App

This project is a simple and interactive text area built with React. It allows users to type text and see it updated in real-time on the screen. Additionally, users can perform basic operations such as converting the text to uppercase or lowercase, copying the content to the clipboard, and clearing the text box.

## Features

- **Realtime Text Display**: As you type, the text is updated live on the screen.
- **Convert to Uppercase**: Convert the entire text to uppercase with a single click.
- **Convert to Lowercase**: Convert the entire text to lowercase with a single click.
- **Copy Content**: Copy the current content of the text area to your clipboard.
- **Clear Text**: Clear the text area completely.
